In this thesis I investigated previous implementations of monitoring systems in
\kszkfull of \schfull and researched other modern technologies that can handle
this task. With \kszk's members we decided to use VictoriaMetrics and Loki to
achieve our goals. I designed an architecture around these softwares and
implemented most parts of the new system. At the point of writing he proof of
concept system was running for more than a month already. Members of \kszk
started integrating their own servers with the help of the implemented
Countinous Integration. The system proved to be successful so far.

During my work I learnt much about Kubernetes, monitoring systems,
configuration management and Continous Integration.

There is still work to be done. In my opinion this solution has the potential
to stay and server \kszk's needs for a very long time after completition.
